Our project has officially begun! We've met with our head of school, Diane, as well as George Shillinger and Kristin Reed of The Leatherback Trust and they've all given their permission and support for the project to go forward. Our current step is to define the scope and needs for the project: exactly what do biologists need in order to significantly improve the way they study sea turtle nests, and what portion of that can we deliver to them? I think one of the biggest learnings for us so far is the importance of this skill--to properly define the project, from the beginning.
