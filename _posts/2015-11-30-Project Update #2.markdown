We're currently wrapping up applying for grants for the project. It's been a lot of work, but we're hopeful that we'll be succesful on at least one of them. When we first went into the process, we thought it would take some effort, but that we'd be able to tweak a standard proposal for each grant we applied to. That was much less true than we thought. Every grant is looking for something different--maybe one organization is looking to see how a project will benefit a community, while another is focused on aiding students, while another looks to make environmental change. All are different audiences, and require a different tone for each grant proposal.
