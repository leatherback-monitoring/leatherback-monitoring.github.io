We just received news that we've received a grant from the Moore Family Foundation to cover the full costs of our project! We're super excited and grateful to them for their support. Currently, we're working on the preliminary designs for a basic prototype of our sensor. Because a waterproof case is pretty difficult, we've been looking into existing solutions--project boxes--that we could buy from China and ship over. However, there are all sorts of logistical issues from buying something from a wholesaler site like Alibaba--there's no normal direct shipping option like there is for consumer goods. Often, you are responsible for getting the project from a specific port to your address, which is probably more complicated than we need--especially due to the fact we're only making a little over 100 sensors.
