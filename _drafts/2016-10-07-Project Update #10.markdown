We've moved into testing the prototype square sensor, which is rather exciting! 

There's a number of things we're looking for when testing. On the electronics side, it's battery life, temperature recording fidelity, timing accuracy, and other weird bugs we might not have previously caught. On the mechanical side, we're making sure the case actually does resist sand and water, the case doesn't degrade, the battery doesn't corrode, and the device is easy to operate. Things that cross both fields include making sure the breather vent allows for accurate humidity measurement and that our temperature and humidity readings are actually accurate.

We tested the waterproofing of the case in a slightly dramatic way. We placed the sensor in some water in a vacuum chamber and then turned on the vacuum machine. If the case were at all permeable, the pressure difference between its outside and its inside would become so great that bubbles would come out of the case, showing that it's not waterproof.

Well, we got bubbles.
