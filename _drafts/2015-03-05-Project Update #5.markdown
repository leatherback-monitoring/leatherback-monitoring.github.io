One of the things we realized about our first prototype is that there's a LOT we need to change. A lot. After fixing a minor snafu with the mill that caused our electronics boards to machine improperly, we have made a through-hole PCB and have soldered a basic prototype. Here's a photo of the CNC Mill cutting our first working prototype board.

It turned on and didn't short circuit the first time we powered it up, which is exciting!
