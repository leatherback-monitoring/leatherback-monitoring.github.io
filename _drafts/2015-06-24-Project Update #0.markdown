If anyone reads this blog, they might be wondering: why turtles? Well, like just about every other species, they play a certain role in their environment that would be disrupted if any population became extinct.

Some sea turtles, like the Green sea turtle, eat grasses. These ocean grazers (along with manatees) play in spreading ocean grass habitat. Because Green turtles cut ocean grass short, it expands across the ocean floor rather than growing up to the surface--creating more habitat for animals that dwell within the sea grass bed.

All sea turtles lay their eggs in the sand of beaches. [Sea Turtle Conservancy](http://www.conserveturtles.org/seaturtleinformation.php?page=whycareaboutseaturtles) estimates turtles can lay as much as 150,000 lbs of eggs along a 20 mile stretch of Florida's east coast. Because a majority of sea turtle eggs fail to make it out of the nest--embryonic development glitches, trapped hatchlings, empty eggs--the nests decompose and become valuable nutrients to the beach environment. Vegetation grows around nests and provides natural erosion control for the beach. 

What do leatherback sea turltes do? Well, they are the only species of sea turtle to eat primarily jellyfish, which partly keeps jellyfish populations in check. The turtles also provide an interesting evolutionary link to the past. The leatherback sea turtle is part of the genus _Dermochelys_, and is the only living species to share this designation. The turtle draws its evolutionary ancestry to 110 million years ago, and so represents a historical group of reptiles that have long been extinct. Studying the leatherback turtle may provide us with insight into these ancient species. 

While the leatherback turtles' Atlantic population levels are relatively steady, Pacific subpopulations have reached an alarmingly low level, and conservation efforts are complicated by our relative lack of knowledge (Spotila et. al 1996). 

Several threats have impacted sea turtle populations: egg poaching, harpooning, plastic marine pollution, commercial fishing accidents, and climate change. As the gender of a sea turtle egg is determined by the temperature of the sand in which it is laid, known as Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination (TSD); rising global temperatures are producing more females. Some nests birth 90% female turtles, potentially skewing oceanic sea turtle sex ratios and making it possibly difficult for females to find mates as they mature (Sieg et al. 2011). 

Temperature monitoring is therefore critical to understanding sea turtle population movements, but current temperature sensors are limited in their capability and labor intensive in retrieving readings. Our project associate The Leatherback Trust oversees the three mile long beach of Playa Grande, where it can take a researcher up to four hours to collect a single temperature reading for each nest. 

As a result, biologists are only able to record temperatures once every other day, providing only a rough image of how temperatures fluctuate over the nesting season. Sensors are additionally prone to breaking, being moved or discarded by tourists, and becoming buried in the sand. 

Our project is to develop and test a temperature sensor that solves these previous issues while increasing measurement frequency, and then to deploy the sensors along the beach. Sensors will be dropped into the nest while the turtle is laying eggs, take hourly temperature measurements for approximately 65 days, and then be removed from the nest during the excavation biologists perform on all hatched nests. The sensor data will then be uploaded to a computer interface that automatically processes and graphs the results, allowing us to analyze information collected while in the nest and easily share that data around the world. 

The information will significantly enhance our understanding of the temperature variations across Playa Grande, potentially helping us better the still-unknown mechanisms behind TSD (Standora and Spotila, 1985). Additionally, temperatures we collect on nests can help us identify exceptionally hot or cold microclimates along the beach, which can be used when deciding if a nest is in significant danger of failure and needs human relocation. 

Improved temperature monitoring will enhance our understanding of how temperature affects general sea turtle populations. Estimates of sea turtle sex ratios at birth will become easier to predict and quantify, leading to enhanced population modeling. As sea turtles can only be sexed by killing the turtle, accurately knowing each nest temperature will allow us to noninvasively estimate the number of male and female hatchlings--saving lives while increasing scientific understanding.
