We have reached a major milestone in our project: sending down prototype sensors to the Leatherback sensors in Costa Rica! We've been working hard over the last couple months to get them ready, so here's an update of what we've accomplished.

* We finished release 0.1.0 of our data downloading software, which looks for an Arduino connection, reads the data off the sensor, and synchronizes said data to real time. As we mentioned (briefly)[link] earlier, our sensor reads absolute time, or time since last reset (i.e. when the sensor is turned on)
