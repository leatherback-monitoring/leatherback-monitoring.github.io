The through-hole prototype is all but finished--we're just having an issue getting the flash memory to work. Since we've tried all three of the flash chips we've ordered, we're wondering if maybe one from another manufacturer will do better--so we've made a little breakout board to go on our prototype.
Due to a software update with the OtherMill combined with the use of a new tool, our PCB machining speed has greatly improved! We can now cut the board in only a few minutes time. Here's a video of the machine cutting out the profile for one of our PCBs.
